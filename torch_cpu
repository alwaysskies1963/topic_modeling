I understand that you're trying to build a Docker image and install PyTorch, but when you try to install a version greater than 1.13.0 with NVIDIA and GPU support, it's throwing an error. You've decided to install just the CPU version of PyTorch to avoid this issue.
To install the CPU-only version of PyTorch, you can use pip with a specific command that excludects the CUDA (GPU) version. Here's how you can do it in your Dockerfile:
dockerfileCopy code# Assuming you're using a Python base image
FROM python:3.8

# Other necessary setup...

# Install PyTorch CPU version
RUN pip install torch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Rest of your Dockerfile...
Let's break down the PyTorch installation command:

torch==1.13.1: This specifies the PyTorch version. You can change this to any version greater than 1.13.0 that you need.
torchvision==0.14.1 and torchaudio==0.13.1: These are complementary libraries often used with PyTorch. The versions are compatible with PyTorch 1.13.1.
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu: This is the key part. It tells pip to look for packages in the PyTorch CPU-only repository, ensuring that you get the CPU version without CUDA.

By using this command, you'll avoid any issues related to NVIDIA or GPU versions of PyTorch. The installation will be smaller and faster since it doesn't include the CUDA libraries.
Remember to replace the versions (1.13.1, 0.14.1, 0.13.1) with the ones you specifically need if they're different. Just make sure they're all compatible with each other.
